1. Vision Statement
1.1 High Concept

"Check-in Life" is the first career-driven, first-person life simulator that blends immersive roleplay, hyper-realistic work loops, and long-term empire-building strategy.

Begin as a broke employee in a failing 2-star motel.

Struggle with low wages, stressed managers, difficult guests, and a decaying apartment.

Master skills in hospitality, leadership, and personal finance.

Rise through corporate ranks, navigate AI-driven hotel ecosystems, and eventually transition into entrepreneurial empire-building—owning, customizing, and branding luxury resorts worldwide.

The game mirrors the grit, grind, and glory of real life, blending roleplay storytelling, management sim depth, and open-world exploration.

1.2 Core Pillars

The Grind is Real – Early-game struggle emphasizes low pay, toxic guests, and workplace stress.

Every Choice Matters – Dialogue, finance, and lifestyle decisions ripple across career, relationships, and reputation.

Visible, Tangible Progression – From a leaky studio to a penthouse suite; from trainee to hotel magnate.

The Living Hospitality World – Each hotel tier is a living organism with guest behaviors, staff politics, and evolving demands.

Dynamic Career Simulation – A constantly changing city economy, staff turnover, guest patterns, and events make every shift unique.
