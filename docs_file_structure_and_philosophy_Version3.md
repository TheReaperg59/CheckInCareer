# File Structure & Philosophy

## Why?
- Prevents chaos, ensures scalability, and enables AAA-quality workflow.
- New contributors can instantly find and understand any system.

## Rules
- Every folder contains a README.md with its purpose.
- Every file and function documents "why" it exists.
- All code, assets, and docs are version-controlled.

## Structure (explained)
- `/src/systems` – Core gameplay systems, each in its own subfolder.
- `/src/assets` – All models, textures, audio, and UI art.
- `/docs` – Every design decision, system rationale, and gameplay doc.
- `/tests` – Automated test coverage for all core logic.
